# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

Please do NOT raise a GitHub Issue to report a security vulnerability. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit a report to tanjimhossain.pro+sec@gmail.com preferably with a proof of concept.

We ask that you do not use other channels or contact project contributors directly.

Non-vulnerability related security issues such as great new ideas for security features are welcome on GitHub Issues.

## Security-Related Information

We will provide security related information such as a threat model, considerations for secure use, or any known security issues in our documentation. Please note that labs and sample code are intended to demonstrate a concept and may not be sufficiently hardened for production use.
