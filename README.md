# ZeroSDP

> **NOTE:** This project is in early development stage and is not ready for production use. The initial design or paper work is done, but the implementation is paused for now.

## Introduction

ZeroSDP is a Continuous Software Delivery and Ops Platform, that aims to deal with day 0 challenges and ease the day 1 - day N concerns.

It's based on Kubernetes CRD that provides integrated CI/CD Pipeline, Application Lifecycle Management, Observability, Security, Governance, Reconciliation and more. Also, it is designed to be extensible and pluggable.

It's also the foundation for the Component-as-a-Service Platform (CompaaS) that hides the complexity of Kubernetes and provides a simple and consistent way to deliver (stateful and stateless) functions, containers, applications, or services as Components.

## Prior Art

ZeroSDP is inspired by the following projects:

- [Verrazzano](https://verrazzano.io/)
- [Kubevela](https://kubevela.io/)
